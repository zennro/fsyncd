This script is an implementation of Linux::Inotify2 and Mac::FSEvents, and effectively
monitors the given path(s) for changes, and the rsyncs these changes to a remote directory
on another machine. We run rsync in such a manner so as to not kill extraneous files that
exist on one end and not the other, but you should be careful in enabling the remote->local
feature. You could lose data easily if something went wrong.

REQUIREMENTS
This script requires that you have a public key setup for the remote server such that no
login credentials need be supplied to rsync/ssh.

You will also need, depending on your platform, a facility to notify the script of filesystem
changes. For Linux, this is inotify. For OS X, this is FSEvents.

Please visit http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/jpmg/ssh/authorized_keys_howto.html for assistance
in setting up a valid keypair.

Usage:
  fsyncd --source=<directory> --target=<remote host:directory> [--delay=<seconds> --queue=<size> --log --no-daemon]

Like most of my other work, this is a utilitarian piece of code I wrote to accomplish something
quickly and as simply as I could understand it.
