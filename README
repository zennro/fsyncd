This script is an implementation of Linux::Inotify2 and Mac::FSEvents, and effectively monitors the given path(s) for changes, and the rsyncs these changes to a remote directory on another machine. We run rsync in such a manner so as to not kill extraneous files that exist on one end and not the other, but you should be careful in enabling the remote->local feature. You could lose data easily if something went wrong.

REQUIREMENTS
This script requires that you have a public key setup for the remote server such that no login credentials need be supplied to rsync/ssh.

You will also need, depending on your platform, a facility to notify the script of filesystem changes. For Linux, this is inotify. For OS X, this is FSEvents.

Please visit http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/jpmg/ssh/authorized_keys_howto.html for assistance
in setting up a valid keypair.

fsyncd - a filesystem event monitor and sync tool
fsyncd --source=<path> --target=<host:path> --queue=<size> --delay=<seconds> --log --dry --nodaemon --help
  --source   - defines the source path to monitor on the local machine
  --target   - defines the target path to sync on the remote machine
  --queue    - defines the number of events to queue before syncing [default=1]
  --delay    - enables polling the remote path for changes [default=0/off]
  --log      - enables logging; automatically disabled if running in daemon mode
  --nodaemon - enables console mode; useful for logging and debugging
  --dry      - enables dry mode; everything is configured and executed except the rsync commands

Like most of my other work, this is a utilitarian piece of code I wrote to accomplish something quickly and as simply as I could understand it.
