This script is an implementation of Linux::Inotify2 and Mac::FSEvents, and effectively
monitors the given path(s) for changes, and the rsyncs these changes to a remote directory
on another machine. We run rsync in such a manner so as to not kill extraneous files that
exist on one end and not the other, but you should be careful in enabling the remote->local
feature. You could lose data easily if something went wrong.

This script requires that you have a public key setup for the remote server such that no
login credentials need be supplied to rsync/ssh.

Please visit http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/jpmg/ssh/authorized_keys_howto.html for assistance
in setting up a valid keypair.

Usage:
  fsyncd --source=<directory> --target=<remote host:directory> [--delay=<seconds> --queue=<size>]

Like most of my other work, this is a utilitarian piece of code I wrote to accomplish something
quickly and as simply as I could understand it.

There is no warranty, written or implied, nor a guarantee of fit for use of anything in particular.
